  <h2>Hello! I'm Chris Eldredge.</h2>
  <p>
  	I'm a software engineer based in Washingon, DC. I like working on
  	all kinds of server-side goodies and specialize in build tools and
  	deployment orchestration in the pursuit of Developer Happiness.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Currently I'm working for
  	<a href="https://www.fool.com/">The Motley Fool</a>,
  	consolidating more than 20 years of content into a new service that
  	provides storage, retrieval, aggregation and search all powered by Solr.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I've dabbled in <a href="/projects/">creating and contributing</a>
  	to the open source ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Occasionally I <a href="/blog/archives">write</a> about
  	software engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When I'm not working, I'm probably
  	<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21503370-chris-eldredge">
  	reading</a>, cooking, drinking old-man drinks, studying Korean language 
  	with <a href="http://talktomeinkorean.com">Talk To Me In Korean</a> or
  	playing Nintendo games.
